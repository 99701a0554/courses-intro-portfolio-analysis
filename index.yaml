- chapter_title: Introduction to portfolio analysis [Chapter 1]
  chapter_description: The data analysis of a financial portfolio involves studying the individual asset values and returns, and their weight in the total portfolio. In this chapter you will learn about the key data inputs when analyzing portfolio performance in R; the portfolio weights, the underlying investment returns and the calculation of portfolio values.

      title   : Portfolio weights
      content : It is not a good idea to put all your eggs in the same basket. In order to diversify her exposure to risk, the typical investor invests in multiple financial assets. This can vary from an investment in various types of stocks to exchange traded funds pursuing different investment styles or investments in different asset classes. The weight of an investment equals the value of that investment divided by total value of all investments. Suppose eg an investor has 1000 USD and she buys 200 USD of Apple and 800 USD of MSFT, then the weights are 20% and 80%. This is a simple example of two stocks. The general recommendation is to have at least 20 stocks in an equity portfolio, and to allocate your wealth across at least six asset classes (domestic equities, foreign equities, corporate bonds, government bonds, real estate and commodities).

      title   : Calculating characteristic-based portfolio weights 
      content : In a characteristic-based portfolio, the weight is given by the asset's characteristic vaue divided by the sum of the characteristic values of all assets. A typical example is the market capitalization weighted portfolio. Define the vector 'Characteristics' as the sequence from 1 to 100 and compute the corresponding 'ComponentWeights' as 'Characteristics/sum(Characteristics)'.

A typical example is the market capitalization weighted portfolio. Define the vector 'Characteristics' as the sequence from 1 to 100 and compute the corresponding 'ComponentWeights' as 'Characteristics/sum(Characteristics)'.

      title   : Portfolio returns
      content : The value of investment changes. The investment return is the change in investment value, relatively to the initial investment. Suppose that, in our example of 1000 USD invested in Apple and 9000 USD in MSFT, the Apple investment rises to 1100 USD and the value of the MSFT position does not change, then the return in Apple is (1100-1000)/1000 = 10%, versus 0% for Apple. Clearly, the weight allocation will be influential for the portfolio performance. In general, the portfolio return equals the average of the returns of the component positions, each of them multiplied with their portfolio weight. On the slide I show a proof of this for two assets. Extends to the general case.

      title   : Calculation of portfolio returns
      content : The initial vector of component values is 'in.values=c(1000,5000,2000)'. Suppose that the value changes to 'fin.values=c(1100,4500,3000)'. Define 'in.weights = in.values/sum(in.values)' as the weights at the start of the investment horizon.  Define 'returns = (fin.values-in.values)/in.values' as the returns of the three components. Verify that the weighted average portfolio return ( 'sum(in.weights*returns)'  ) equals the percentage change in the total portfolio value (sum(fin.values)-sum(in.values))/sum(in.values).

      content : An alternative definition of return used in finance is log-returns. Let us now verify that log-returns do not have the portfolio aggregation property.  Define 'logreturns = log(fin.values)-log(in.values)' as the returns of the three components. Verify that the weighted average portfolio return ( 'sum(in.weights*logreturns)'  ) does not equal the log-return computed on the total portfolio value (log(sum(fin.values))-log(sum(in.values))).

      title   : The distribution of portfolio returns
      content : We have now mostly looked at time series plots of returns. For portfolio managers and investors the distribution of returns is important. This can be visualized by a histogram (function hist() in R) or by reporting summary statistics. The first important statistic is the mean return, showing the average portfolio performance. Usually, a higher average return comes at the price of a higher risk. The sample variance corresponding to the average squared deviations of the return with respect to the average return is the risk measure used in modern portfolio theory by Harry Markowitz. The square root of the variance, called standard deviation or volatility, is more easy to interpret because it is in the same units as the returns.

      title   : Downside risk; skewness, kurtosis and value-at-risk
      content : The mean and volatility fully describe the return distribution, when the return distribution is normal. In practice, as can be seen also in the histogram, most financial return distributions are not-normal. They are asymmetric and have so-called heavy tails. This means that the tails are fatter than the ones of a normal distribution. The asymmetry is measured by skewness, which is the average value of the third power of the return deviations from their average, standardized by their volatility. If it is negative,.... Kurtosis; fourth power ... Excess kurtosis. When returns are non-normal, the volatility is not sufficient as a risk measure. A downside risk measure needs to be used, focusing on the probability of large losses. 5% value at risk; quantile ...  . Drawdowns.
