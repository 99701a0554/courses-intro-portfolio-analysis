**Course: Intro to Portfolio Analysis**

_Chapter_**: 3**

- **“The Sources of Portfolio Performance”**
    - _Exercise Description_: another which one is false. Needs to change.
    - _Pre-loaded tex_t: General grammar needs to be fixed.
    - _Instructions_:

- **“Sensitivity of the Sharpe Ratio to the Portfolio Weights”**
    - _Exercise Description_:
        -  Needs some substance. perhaps describe how the for loop he created works. Why each vector is created and how it works to calculate sharpe etc

    - _Pre-loaded tex_t:
        - instructions don’t completely match 

    - _Instructions_:
        - objects he tells us to use do not exist

- **“The Drivers in case of two assets”**
    - _Exercise Description_: 
    - _Pre-loaded tex_t:
    - _Instructions_:

- **“Interpreting Correlation”**
    - _Exercise Description_: remove “thus” remove “a” before static and dynamic
    - _Pre-loaded tex_t: 
    - _Instructions_: objects aren’t loaded

- **“The Impact of Correlation on Performance”**
    - _Exercise Description_: needs rewriting
    - _Pre-loaded tex_t:
    - _Instructions_:

- **“The General Case Using Matrix Notation”**
    - _Exercise Description_:
    - _Pre-loaded tex_t:
    - _Instructions_:

- **“The Asset Allocation Problem”**
    - _Exercise Description_:
    - _Pre-loaded tex_t:
        - why are there preloaded graphs? Confusing for the student.
            - if you’re going to use graphs mention them in the description and describe what they do

        - where does weights come from?
            - weights should be separate from the instruction that tells you to calculate returns
            - is weight a vector? etc.

        - includes object “returns_merged” no instruction for it

    - _Instructions_:
        - use merge function? inner_join? etc

- **“Avoiding Loops In Calculating Vector of Estimates”**
    - _Exercise Description_:
        - create a real description

    - _Pre-loaded tex_t:
        - remove “sample code”

    - _Instructions_:
        - explain arguments of apply() function
        - no need for such an elaborate for plot in 3rd direction
            - just plot(vsd, means)
            - lty argument isn’t needed
            - should be plot `vsd` against `means`. add horizontal line at 0 using `abline()`
                - consult documentation if you need help

- **“Portfolio Volatility”**
    - _Exercise Description_: this needs an ACTUAL description
    - _Pre-loaded tex_t: #sample code is not sufficient
    - _Instructions_: add actual instructions

- **“The Portfolio’s Risk Budget”**
    - _Exercise Description_:
    - _Pre-loaded tex_t:
    - _Instructions_:

- **“Whodunit”**
    - change the title….
    - _Exercise Description_: create a description
    - _Pre-loaded tex_t: 
    - _Instructions_:
        - #1 don’t just give us the code you want used
        - #2 too vague. use the word “merge” if thats the function you want the student to use

- FOR ALL EXERCISE:
    - need success messages that recap what occurred in the exercise
    - rewrite exercise descriptions: unnecessarily verbose. Language doesn’t fit in many places
    - code / functions in instructions need to be surrounded by `code` not documentation links
        - Documentation can be found using ?function

    - Don’t just say “Do the same thing” 
        - i.e calculate mean, do the same thing for sd
            - say calculate mean, calculate sd

    - A lot of exercise have a 1 sentence description with awful punctuation spelling grammar
    - a lot of exercises pre-loaded code is “#sample code”
        - this is not sufficient
