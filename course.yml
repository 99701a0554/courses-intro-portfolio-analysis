title            : Introduction to Portfolio Analysis
author_field     : Kris Boudt
description      : A golden rule in investing is to seek for diversification and always test the portfolio strategy on historical data, and, once you are trading the strategy, to constantly monitor its performance. In this course, you will learn this by critically analyzing portfolio returns and finding the portfolio weights that optimally balance risk and return. The course proceeds in four chapters. In Chapter 1 you will learn the ins and outs of computing and plotting portfolio return series in R. Chapter 2 is about analyzing portfolio performance in R. You will learn about the typical features of a portfolio return distribution and summary statistics such as annualized mean returns, volatility and Sharpe ratios, together with statistics for downside risk analysis. Chapters 3 and 4 are about optimizing the portfolio decision. This requires a multivariate view. Chapter 3 shows how the portfolio variance is a function of the assets individual volatility and all the correlations between the returns of the different assets. Chapter 4 then provides the tools to optimize portfolio decisions and choose portfolios that are efficient. It is not possible to have a higher return with less risk, or a lower risk with higher return. All together, these four chapters learn you to analyse portfolio returns in R, which is a crucial skill to make investment profits without taking excessive risks.
