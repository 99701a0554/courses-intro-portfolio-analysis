# Video 1: Introduction to the course

Welcome! Welcome to this course on portfolio analysis in R. My name is Kris Boudt. I am a Professor of finance at the free university of Brussel and Amsterdam. Besides my teaching and research, I also advise investment companies about best practices in portfolio management. 

My princicpal advice is to take investment decisions seriously and be aware of the risks involved in investing. Whenever you buy a stock or bond at some price, this price will change in the future. If it increases, you make a profit. If it decreases, you make a loss.

There are some simple tricks to reduce the risk of making large losses. 

The first one is to seek for portfolio risk diversification. This means that one should avoid investing in one single asset, because by choosing intelligent combinations of investments, it becomes possible to increase return and reduce the risk.

Another golden  rule in investing is to always test the portfolio strategy on historical data. And, once you are trading the strategy, to constantly monitor its performance. For this reason Datacamp is one of the best ways to learn portfolio analysis: I will teach you the theory in short videos and provide you the R instructions to do the portfolio analysis in practice.

The course proceeds in four chapters. 

In Chapter 1 I will show you how to compute portfolio returns in R. 

Chapter 2 is about your skills to evaluate the portfolio performance. 

Chapters 3 and 4 are about optimizing the portfolio decision. This requires a multivariate view. Chapter 3 shows how the portfolio variance is a function of the assets individual volatility and all the correlations between the returns of the different assets. Chapter 4 then provides the tools to optimize portfolio decisions and choose portfolios that are efficient. It is not possible to have a higher return with less risk, or a lower risk with higher return. 

All together, these four chapters learn you to analyse portfolio return in R, which is a crucial skill to make investment profits without taking excessive risks.
